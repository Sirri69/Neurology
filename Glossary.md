# Glossary

- **Somatosensory**: The somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the brain and body that produce the perception of touch, as well as temperature, body position, and pain. It is a subset of the sensory nervous system, which also represents visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli. ^d90499
- **Receptive Field**: The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a sensory neuronal response in specific organisms. Complexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive field for touch perception. ^5efcda
- **Retinotopic Map**: Term referring to the fact that the precise spatial arrangement of the retina is maintained throughout the visual pathway. ^e856bf
- **Hypercolumn**: A Hypercolumn is a group of nerve cells in the brain that helps us interpret what we see by enabling us to analyze the size, shape, speed, and direction of visual stimuli. It is a set of columns that function as a unit that enables us to see one specific portion of the visual field.
- **Deoxyglucose:** Deoxyglucose is a molecule that is similar to glucose, but with a minor change in its structure. That change causes this molecule to get stuck in the metabolic chain. And so it gets taken up by cells that wanna take glucose, and then it get stuck it there and cannot be broken down. Hence, it builds up in cells that are metabolically active. You can put a radioactive tracer in deoxyglucose, inject it into a person or animal, then it builds up as a radioactive tag on all the cells that were metabolically active.

- Fusiform Face Area: The fusiform face area (FFA, meaning spindle-shaped face area) is a part of the human visual system (while also activated in people blind from birth) that is specialized for facial recognition. It is located in the inferior temporal cortex (IT), in the fusiform gyrus ^d42ddf
